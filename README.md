# Overview
This course is designed to give you an overview of some of the main areas of philosophy, and a taster of some of the topics and questions you might study as part of a degree programme in philosophy. In each module a different member of staff will introduce you to some of the questions that they think are most interesting or important in their particular area of expertise.

For each module, the main content for the course will be a series of video lectures, taking between 30 and 45 minutes in total, and split into 10-15 minute chunks. You can also look at copies of the slides that the lecturers use in their video presentations, and in some modules lecturers will upload a handout which you might like to have alongside you while you watch the videos (if just to give you something on which to scribble any interesting ideas that come to you). There is no reading or preparation required to complete the course beyond watching and critically thinking about the content of the lectures. However, for each module you will be directed to additional readings and resources that you can use to follow up the topics from the course that most interest you.

# Week 1 - module: What is Philosophy?

## A. What is philosophy?

### 1. Definition
- definition of 'philosophy':  philosophy is the activity of working out the right way of thinking about things
 > an 'activity' rather than a 'subject': involves action

- To genuinely understand philosophy, you need to DO IT: you need to work through philosophical problems, think about and analyse the ways other thinkers have approached these issues.

### 2. Difference between philosophy and other subjects
All subjects (e.g. physics) think about things.
What distinguishes philosophy is that it focuses on working out the BEST way of thinking about things.
> This entails stepping back from the 'normal' way of thinking and questioning it: question its assumptions, presuppositions, conclusions, whether it's the best possible way to go about things (in the realm of the given subject).

### 3. Blurry Borders between philosophy and other subjects
Because philosophy involves questioning, stepping back from the current state of thinking, the current way of doing things, it can virtually be applied to any subjects: philosophy of physics, philosophy of medicine, etc.

>philosophy of physics: we might ask: ‘What do we mean by “physical reality”?’, 
‘How do experimental results confirm or disconfirm a hypothesis?’, or ‘What distinguishes a good scientific theory from a bad one?’

## B. Philosophy: Difficult, Important, Everywhere.

### 1. Philosophy: Fundamental?
Is it true that all philosophical questions are fundamental in nature?

- Somehow Not True: 
> You can ask plenty of questions that do not need to be philosophical.
> There are equally plenty of actions you can undertake without any philosophical methodology and questioning.

> e.g. it's in the best interest for all that neurosurgeons do not 'step back' and ponder whether they are thinking about the brain in the best way every single time they perform a surgery. Philosophical questioning is not fundamental for pursuing a myriad of activities; even further, doing philosophy can hinder doing some activities.

- Somehow True:
> No matter the kind of questions you’re asking, or activities you’re performing, further philosophical questions can always arise: 'the Whys never end'.

> the reason why philosophy is so broad: you can question the presuppositions of any activity, thought process, anytime and anywhere.

### 2. Philosophy: Important?
Is it true that all philosophical questions are important in nature?

- Somehow Not True:
> Because you can step back from anything and ask questions about any activity, way of doing things and way of thinking about things, there are questions that are seemingly 'trivial' or 'boring' to even bother asking.

- Somehow True:
Philosophy as its best, is often important.
> Most philosophy (worthwile philosophy) "aims at thinking clearly about the things that matter most to us."

> Thinking philosophically (e.g. stepping back and examining presuppositions) can help us question or see past dogma, accepted wisdom that may not be the best thing for us to think or believe (no longer).
