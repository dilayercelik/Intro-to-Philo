# Intro-to-Philo
Notes for the 'Introduction to Philosophy' course offered by The University of Edinburgh through Coursera.

# Acknowledgements
The development of this MOOC has been led by the University of Edinburgh's Eidyn research centre.

# Overview
This course is designed to give you an overview of some of the main areas of philosophy, and a taster of some of the topics and questions you might study as part of a degree programme in philosophy. In each module a different member of staff will introduce you to some of the questions that they think are most interesting or important in their particular area of expertise.

For each module, the main content for the course will be a series of video lectures, taking between 30 and 45 minutes in total, and split into 10-15 minute chunks. You can also look at copies of the slides that the lecturers use in their video presentations, and in some modules lecturers will upload a handout which you might like to have alongside you while you watch the videos (if just to give you something on which to scribble any interesting ideas that come to you). There is no reading or preparation required to complete the course beyond watching and critically thinking about the content of the lectures. However, for each module you will be directed to additional readings and resources that you can use to follow up the topics from the course that most interest you.
